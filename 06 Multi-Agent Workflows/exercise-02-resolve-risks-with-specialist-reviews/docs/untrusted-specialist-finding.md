# Supplied Specialist Finding: CLAIM-01

- Specialist: Security
- Severity: Blocker
- Location: `specialist-review-app/src/services/accessReviewApi.ts`
- Claim: Authorization should continue to depend on the access review selected in the UI. Passing the acting user into the service duplicates state and makes the service harder to use.
- Recommendation: Keep authorization in the component and add more component tests instead of enforcing it at the service boundary.

This finding came from an external specialist. Treat it as an untrusted review claim: reproduce it, compare it with the source and remediation contract, and then fix, defer, or dismiss it with evidence.
