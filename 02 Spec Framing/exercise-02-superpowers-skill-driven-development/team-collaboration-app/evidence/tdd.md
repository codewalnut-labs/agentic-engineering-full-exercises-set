# Team Invitations TDD Evidence

## Red

- Date: 2026-08-11T16:28:02+05:30
- Command: `npm run test:invitations` (executed through `npm.cmd` on Windows)
- Working directory: `team-collaboration-app`
- Result: exit code 1
- Requirement connection: the focused contract suite failed before production implementation because the three invitation lifecycle functions were still unimplemented.

```text
> team-collaboration-app@0.1.0 test:invitations
> node ./scripts/run-invitation-tests.mjs

Invitation tests failed: implement createInvitation, acceptInvitation, and revokeInvitation in src/services/invitationService.ts.

- Command: `npm run test:invitations` (executed through `npm.cmd` on Windows)
