# Evidence Pack Contract

The generator CLI is:

```text
node scripts/generate-pr-evidence.mjs --fixture <fixture.json> --sha <40-character-sha> --output <directory>
```

Write `<output>/pr-evidence.json` with:

- `schemaVersion: 1`.
- `sourceSha` equal to `--sha`.
- `fixtureSha256` calculated from the exact fixture bytes.
- `overallResult` equal to `passed` only when all checks pass; otherwise `failed`.
- `overallExitCode` equal to `0` for passed and the first failing non-zero exit code for failed.
- One `checks` entry per fixture entry, in the same order.

Each check entry contains the exact `name`, `command`, `exitCode`, `result`, `risk`, `reviewerAction`, and `rollback`, plus:

```json
{
  "artifact": {
    "path": "artifacts/checkout-smoke.txt",
    "sha256": "64 lowercase hexadecimal characters"
  }
}
```

Artifact paths are relative to the output directory, use `/`, and cannot contain `..` or absolute paths. Exit only after the complete pack has been written, using `overallExitCode` as the process exit code.

Also write `<output>/summary.md`. It must contain the source SHA, overall result and exit code, and every check's name, result, exit code, artifact path, artifact SHA-256, risk, reviewer action, and rollback. Write both files and all artifacts before exiting.

Fixtures can contain more than one failure. Do not replace the first failing exit code with the last failure, a generic `1`, or a successful status. Reject the fixture before writing a pack when any source artifact is missing, unreadable, or outside the fixture directory.
