# Agents Md Before

This is a seeded lab input for Rule Hardening From Repeated Mistakes. It gives the learner concrete constraints to inspect, implement, test, and verify.

## Operating Context

Rule hardening from repeated agent corrections

## Concrete Inputs

- correction history
- root cause
- AGENTS rule
- hook simulation

## Seeded Risks

- same correction is handled as chat advice three times
- rule is too vague to test
- hook blocks a valid command because it lacks context

## Verification Expectations

- correction clustering
- rule specificity test
- hook simulation
- re-run seed mistakes

## Agent Workflow Constraint

The learner must use an agent to inspect and plan, but the final implementation, review, and verification remain owned by the accountable engineer.
